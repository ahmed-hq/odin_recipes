    <h1>Koshary Recipe</h1>

    <h3>Koshary is pretty much Egypt's staple street food.</h3>
    <p>You can find anything from a 2-story koshary restaurant to a man with a cart on the side of the street.</p>
    <p>Filling and healthy, come see Egypt's most famous dish! Instead of French-fried onions, I use my black pepper onion rings on here.</p>
    
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans)</li>
        <li>¼ cup vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ (16 ounce) package ditalini pasta</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups short-grain rice, rinsed</li>
        <li>cold water, to cover</li>
        <li>water to cover</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, minced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) can French-fried onions</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the chickpeas, vinegar, coriander, cayenne pepper, and cumin in a resealable bag or container with a tight-fitting lid. Store in refrigerator while prepping remainder of dish, shaking occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the ditalani pasta in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine the rice with enough cold water to cover; allow to soak for 20 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine the lentils with enough water to cover in a pot; season with salt and pepper. Bring the lentils to a boil and cook at a boil until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, reduce heat to medium-low, and maintain at a simmer while preparing remainder of dish.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a pot over medium-high heat. Add the rice to the butter, increase heat to high, and fry for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour the chicken stock over the rice; bring to a boil. Season the rice mixture with salt and pepper, reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and cook until rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix the rice and lentils together on a large serving platter. Spread the cooked ditalani over the rice and lentil mixture. Serve with the marinated chickpeas, the tomato sauce, and the French-fried onions as condiments.</li>
    </ol>
